## Jobs Based Career Experience Audit

**Step 1:** Review your resume (no more than 15 years) and at write down (for each company) answers to the following questions:

– What were the biggest problems I solved?
– How did I solve those problems?
– How did I move the needle for the business by solving those problems?

**Step 2:** Now go back again and write down (for each company) the answers to the following questions:

– When was I happiest? why?
– When was I not the happiest? why?
– When did I feel like I was thriving? why?
– When was I not thriving? why?
– What cultural values did I value most?
– What were the traits I admired most in the leaders I enjoyed working for/with?

Step 2 is a really important exercise. It allows you to extract your core values. It reminds you what is important to you. It allows you to know what to screen for as you go forward.

It allows you to be intentional and make heart-centric decisions.

**Step 3:** Study 15 to 25 job descriptions for your goal role - typically 1 level above your most recent title (i.e., if you’re Director, look at Senior Director)

Study the responsibilities carefully and match them up with your responsibilities/experiences. For each of the major responsibilities ask yourself:

- Do I have experience with this?
- Do I enjoy doing this?
